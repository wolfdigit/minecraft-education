    "In Python, if you want to run something multiple times (without copying and pasting code lots of times), you use what is called a loop.   \n",
    "There are 2 main types of loops in Python:\n",
    "- **For loop** - Use this if you know how many times you want to loop for.\n",
    "- **While loop** - Use this if you don't know how many times you are going to want to loop for.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be focusing on the **For loop** in this world.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A **for loop** is created using the following syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for count in range(0, 5):\n",
    "    say(\"Hello\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above code will run the `say(\"hello\")` command 5 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Create a simple program below that outputs (via say() ) a message 8 times.**"
